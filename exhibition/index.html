    <h1>The Moving Pictures</h1>
    <h2>Curated by Hassan Muhammad</h2>
    <p1> Welcome to my exhibition, a space designed for you to
Experience the beauty and potential of GIF animation net art. Here, not only will you view the artworks, but you will also feel a sense of positivity as you.
Engage with them. Each piece is crafted to evoke feelings of awe and satisfaction. The artworks presented in this exhibition feature a
Captivating juxtaposition of images, colors, motion, and forms. These three projects share a commonality.
And that's a looping GIF animation. However, first, let's discuss the GIF image format. The GIF image format was created on June 15, 1987, by a team of developers.
At a team led by computer scientist Steve Wilhite on Compuserve. This format was created to provide a means of reducing the size of images and short animations, which made it easier to
Transmit and store graphic files over the internet. However, GIF has evolved over the years. During the 1987 era, GIF was able to support animations and
Creating illusions of movement by looping several images in sequence. However, with the emergence of the 2000s era and the rise of social media, apps like Tumblr and Twitter capitalized on the format's potential.
To loop animations. However, in today's age, GIFs are photos created with editing software tools, containing high-quality visuals in small areas. Now back to the PROJECTS!!!!
These projects contain animation of colors moving and changing.
Pictures forming, and motion happening all at once. The beauty of looping GIF animation is that you get to see the art forming and moving.
Over and over again, non-stop, it makes the viewers want to keep staring at it to grasp every single detail of the art. Personally
Personally speaking, I receive a sense of completeness while viewing a GIF animation and just watching it finish itself and then do it all over again.
That's what really made me choose these three particular projects.
