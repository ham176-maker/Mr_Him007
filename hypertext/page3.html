<br>You travel 10 years back</br>
<br>You glance at everything around you, everything around is like what you've seen before when you were younger</br>
<br>You start recognizing things around you, the old corner store, the blue park you always used to go to, then the old elementary school you used to go to</br>
<br>You then start to develop nostalgic feelings and a sense of old times</br> 
<br>You come up with a thought to walk down to your old neighborhood to see how things were back then</br> 
<br>As youre walking down the street to your old neighborhood, you see your very younger self playing with a blue ball</br>
<br>Your younger self sees you and walks up to you</br>
<br>You start to gain nervous feelings</br>
<br>Your younger waves and says "hello"</br> 
<br>What do you do as a response?</br>
