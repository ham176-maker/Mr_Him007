<br><p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">But then your younger self instantly backs away from you and starts screaming.</br>
<br>"AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!! SOMEONE HELP!!!!!!! STRANGER DANGER!!!!!!!! Your younger self shouted. Luckily, there was no one around.</br>
<br>"Hey, hey, hey, shhhhh, it's okay, don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you, kid."</br>
<br>Why are you trying to hug me? Your younger self questioned.</br>
<br>"I'm sorry about that, I don't know what came over me. I didn't mean to scare you.</br>
<br>"It's ok. My mommy told me not to talk to strangers. Are you a stranger? Your younger self questioned.</br>
<br>Oh heavens no, I'm no stranger. I'm a friend instead. You said expressively.</br>
<br>You now start to gain memories of your mother telling you not to talk to strangers. Making you feel a sense of awe.</br>
<br>"Oh, ok! Hey! Since you're a friend, you wanna come play with me? Your younger self asked.</br>
<br>What would you do?</br>
<br><a href="page8.html" target="blank"><strong><button style="color: orangered;">*Play with your younger self*</button></strong></a></br>
<br>or</br>
