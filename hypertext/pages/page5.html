<br><p style="color: palevioletred; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Your younger replies with a question, "Do you know where the ice cream shop is?"</br>
<br>You reply, "Of course I do, if you walk down 3 blocks and turn right, the ice cream shop should be to the left"</br>
<br>"Thank you. My mommy says if I eat all my dinner tonight, she'll take me to get ice cream."</br>
<br>Because your younger self said this, it gave you an instant flashback to the moment where you didn't like eating your dinner, mainly vegetables</br>
<br>You try to encourage your younger self to eat all of dinner tonight</br>
<br>"Oh wow, that's great!! Hey, if I were you, I would eat all of dinner and leave no scraps, so that you can enjoy ice cream."</br>
<br>Your younger self replies, "Okay, oh, and I have another question, what's your favorite ice cream flavor?"</br>
<br>"My favorite flavor is cookies and cream"</br>
<br>"Oh wow, that's my favorite flavor too! Cookies and cream is the best"</br>
<br>"It sure is"</br>
<br>Your younger self then asks another question, "Hey, you wanna play with me?"</br>
<br>What would you do?</br>
