<br><h1 style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: big;">You say hello to your self, then spark up a conversation</h1></br>

<br><p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Your younger self replies with a question, "Do you know where the ice cream shop is?" 

You respond, "Of course! If you walk down three blocks and turn right, the ice cream shop should be on the left." 

"Thank you! My mommy says if I eat all my dinner tonight, she'll take me to get ice cream." 

Hearing this triggers a flashback to when you didn't like eating dinner, especially the vegetables. You try to encourage your younger self to eat all of their dinner tonight. 

"Oh wow, that's great! Hey, if I were you, I would eat all of my dinner and leave no scraps so that I can enjoy ice cream." 

Your younger self replies, "Okay! Oh, and I have another question: What's your favorite ice cream flavor?" 

"My favorite flavor is cookies and cream." 

"Oh wow, that's my favorite flavor too! Cookies and cream are the best!" 

"It sure is!" 

Then your younger self asks another question, "Hey, do you want to play with me?" 

What would you do?
