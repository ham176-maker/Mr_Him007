<h1 style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: big;">You say hello to yourself, then spark up a conversation</h1>

<p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Your younger self replies with a question, <br>"Do you know where the ice cream shop is?"</br>

You respond, <br>"Of course! If you walk down three blocks and turn right, the ice cream shop should be on the left."</br>

<br>"Thank you! My mommy says if I eat all my dinner tonight, she'll take me to get ice cream."</br> 

Hearing this triggers a flashback to when you didn't like eating dinner, especially the vegetables. You try to encourage your younger self to eat all of their dinner tonight. 

<br>"Oh wow, that's great! Hey, if I were you, I would eat all of my dinner and leave no scraps so that I can enjoy ice cream."</br>

Your younger self replies, <br>"Okay! Oh, and I have another question: What's your favorite ice cream flavor?"</br>

<br>"My favorite flavor is cookies and cream."</br> 

<br>"Oh wow, that's my favorite flavor too! Cookies and cream are the best!"</br>

<br>"It sure is!"</br>

Then your younger self asks another question, <br>"Hey, do you want to play with me?"</br>

<br>What would you do?</br>
