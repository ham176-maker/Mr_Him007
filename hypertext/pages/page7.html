<br><p style="color: violet; font-size: large; font-weight: bold;">But while in the moment of saying your name, you start to gain a feeling of vibration inside you.</br>
<br>"Hello my name is-- agggh!!!"</br>
<br>"Whoa, dude, are you ok? Your future self said in a worried tone.</br>
<br>"I don't know, I feel like I'm vibrating inside, and it hurts"</br>
<br>You then start to hear constant beep noises "BEEP" "BEEP" "BEEP"</br>
<br>You look at your wrist and see that your timewatch has passed 20 minutes. You then realized to yourself,</br>
<br>"Oh no, my time is up"</br> 
<br>"Time? What are you talking about?" Your futurself responded.</br>
<br>A blue portal then dramatically spawns in afar from you and your future self, ready to suck you in and take you back to the present day.</br>
<br>"Whoa! What the heck is that thing!?!"</br>
<br>"It's the blue portal, it's gonna suck me in and take me back to the present day," You responded.</br>
<br>"Present day!?! What are you talking about, dude?"</br>
<br>Yourself and everything else start to float, and then the portal begins sucking you in, but your future self grabs you in an instant.</br>
<br>"Hold on, don't let go, I got you!!!" Your future self yelled.</br>
<br>"Agghh, I don't know if I can hold on any longer!!"</br>
<br>"Look, you have to let me go, let the portal take me." You responded.</br>
<br>"What!?! That's crazy, you could die. Plus, you don't know where that portal is going to take you," Your future self said in a worried tone.</br>
<br>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing, I'm not going to die. We will meet again." You said confidently.</br>
<br>"*Sigh*, Ok, I hope you know what you're doing." Your future self lets you go, then you enter the portal.</br>
<br>"WOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!"</br>
