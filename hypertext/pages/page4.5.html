<br><p style="color:white ; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">Your futurself heard something for a moment, your futureself stopped and looked around his/her surroundings.</br>
<br>But then your futureself looked at what was in front of them, and became in shock.</br>
<br>"Woah! What heck!?! I almost ran into that thing. I better get out this alleyway." Your future self stated.</br>
<br>After that moment, you took a huge sigh of relief and sat down for a second. You start to feel a sense of gratefulness and relief because you saved your future self from a dangerous incident.</br> 
<br>But then you hear these beeping noises close to you, "BEEP" "BEEP" "BEEP". That's the sound of your time watch beeping, because 20 minutes have passed and you now start vibrating.</br>
<br>"Oh man, what is this feeling? Why am I vibrating? You thought to yourself.</br>  
<br>A blue portal then opens dramatically, sucking you in to bring you back to the present time.</br>
<br> You and everything around you start to float, then you get sucked into the portal, going back to the present.</br> 
<br>WOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You shouted</br>
