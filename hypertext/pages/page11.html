<br>The blue portal spwans in your laboratory, spitting you out making you crash land on your desk.</br>
<br>"Ouch that hurted." You complained.</br>
<br>You now decided to open up your advanced computer to record a recording of yourself about your time travel and the information you've gained and witnessed.</br>
<br>*Starts recording* "Okay" *tap* *tap* "Is this thing on? Okay good, to start off, my name is [personal name].</br>
<br>I have traveled to the past/future. I've worked on this project for over 8 years and it was finally a success.</br>
<br>Time traveling to the past/future was a new full on experience. I've realized that I can go anywhere at anytime.</br>
<br>But during my travels, there's a certain time limit that limited me from staying in the past/future. A big blue portal spwans in and takes you back to the present after 20 minutes, following the credentials from my time watch.
<br>I need to find a way on how I can long strecth my time availability and make my tech more stronger for it to be more durable!!</br>
<br>But traveling to past/future, was a everlasting dream of mine. Comparing the present to the past/future, everything was so vastly different and extraordinary.</br>
<br>I will never stop working, I will never stop researching, I will never stop building, I WILL ALWAYS LOOK FOR NEW WAYS!!!!!!.</br>
<br>But . . . . . I just . . . . . . need more time.</br>
<br>I WILL complete my mission.</br>
<br>This is not the end. This is only . . . . . the beginning.</br>
<br>This is [personal name], signing off for now." *Stops recording*
<br><span>THE END</span></br>
