<br><h1 style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: big;">You decide to play with your younger self</h1></br>

<br><p style="color: brown; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">"Of course I'll play with you," You replied.</br>
<br>"Awesome!" Your younger self shouted. But as your younger self gets some sports balls to play with, you then start to feel vibration inside you, giving you a weird feeling.</br>
<br>"Aggghhh, what is this feeling? Why am I vibrating!?" You questioned.</br>
<br>Your younger self then comes to your aid, "Hey! Are you okay? Why are you on the ground?"</br>
<br>"I don't know, I feel so weird. I feel like my body is twisting, twirling, and shaking inside." You said desperatley.</i></br>
<br>"Twisting? Twirling? Shaking? What do you mean?. Your younger self questioned.</br>
<br>You then began to hear beeping noises, "BEEP" "BEEP" "BEEP". That's the sound of your timewatch beeping, passing 20 mins. You then realized.</br>
<br>"Oh no! Twenty minutes have passed! I'm going back!"</br>
<br>"Going back? Going back where?!!" Your younger self questioned.</br>
<br>A big blue portal then dramatically spawns in from afar, you and your younger self. "OH MY GOSH! WHAT IS THAT!?!" Your younger self shouted.</br>
<br>"It's the portal,, and it's gonna take me back! Look you need to get somewhere safe, or else the blue portal is gonna suck you in too."</br>
<br>"Wait, no! But I can't let it take you. Come into my house with me, you'll be safe in there," Your younger self expressed.</br>
<br>"I'm sorry, but I can't, it's too dangerous! This is all my fault! I'm so sorry." You said sadly.</br>
<br>"What do you mean? What's going on?"</br>
<br>"Don't worry, just go back inside, I don't want you to get hurt. And look, I'll come back for you. I promise." You said confidently.</br>
<br>"Ok, I just want to say, it was nice meeting you, friend"</br>
<br>"Likewise. And remember, please make good decisions. Don't make the same mistakes I made."</br>
<br>Your younger self then looked at you confusingly. "Now, please head back inside!"</br>
<br>"Ok!" Your younger trips on the ground but then gets up quickly to hurry back inside, then watches you from the window.</br>
<br>While you're outside all alone, the blue portal begins to grow even bigger to suck you in. You and everything else around you start to float</br>
<br>The portal then forcefully drags you in, transporting you back to the present day</br>
<br>"WWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!"</br>
