<br><p style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: large;">You glance at everything around you, everything around is like what you've seen before when you were younger</br>
<br>You start recognizing things around you, the old corner store, the blue park you always used to go to, then the old elementary school you used to go to</br>
<br>You then start to develop nostalgic feelings and a sense of old times</br> 
<br>You come up with a thought to walk down to your old neighborhood to see how things were back then</br> 
<br>As youre walking down the street to your old neighborhood, you see your very younger self playing with a blue ball</br>
<br>Your younger self sees you and walks up to you</br>
<br>You start to gain nervous feelings</br>
<br>Your younger waves and says "hello"</br> 
<br>What do you do as a response?</br>
<br><a href="page5.html" target="blank"><strong><button style="color: red;">*Give your younger self a hug*</button></strong></a></br>
<br>or</br> 
<br><a href=page5.html target="blank"><strong><button style="color: red;">*Say "hello" back*</button></strong></a></br></div></p>
