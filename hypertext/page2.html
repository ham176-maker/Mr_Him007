<br>You travel to the future 10 years ahead</br> 
<br>You glance around the atmoshpere and become in a shock state</br>
<br>Everything has neon lights, cars are moving in the air, and everything is technological advanced</br>
<br>You walk down to the neighborhood where you onced lived at to see if anything changed</br>
<br>But while walking down, you see yourself walking down the street</br> 
<br>Your futuristic self looks like, you're in your late thirties, youre wearing bright clothes with high tech boots, and wearing eletrical headphones</br>
<br>You froze in a moment but see a alleyway and hid in it, having a thought you dont't want your future self to see your present self</br>  
<br>You then wait for your future self to walk by, but then you see an eletric wire dangling in youre futureselfs direction but you don't notice it</br>
<br>This causes anxious actions but have the ability to save yourself</br> 
<br>What will you do?</br>
